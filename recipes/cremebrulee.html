    <h3 class = "title">Ingredients</h3><br><br>

    <ul>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2/3 c. vanilla sugar, plus a few teaspoons</li>
        <li>1 vanilla bean</li>
        <li>2 c. heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 c. milk</li>
        <li>1 tbl. bourbon</li>
    </ul><br><br>

    <h3 class = "title">Directions</h3><br><br>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F, and bring 2 qt. of water to a boil.</li><br><br>

        <li>Whisk the egg yolks until lightened. Scrape the beans from the vanilla bean pod and whisk them in.
            Add 2/3 c. of the sugar, and whisk until you reach the ribbon stage. Carefully add the milk, cream,
            and bourbon, then strain to get out any fibrous matter from the vanilla bean.</li><br><br>

        <li>Pour into 6 creme brûlée ramekins or other 4 oz. ramekins. Put the ramekins in a larger lipped pan,
            put them in the oven, then fill the lipped pan with water enough to come half way up the sides of
            the ramekins. Bake 35-45 minutes, until the custard is set but the center still jiggles (the finish
            temperature of the custard, which I like to be just barely set, should be about 185°F.)</li><br><br>

        <li>Remove the ramekins from the water bath and let cool completely in the refrigerator to set up, at <br>
            least 2 hours.</li><br><br>

        <li>About 15 minutes before you want to serve them, remove the ramekins from the refrigerator, and let
            them sit out for 10 minutes. To each ramekin, add about 1 tsp. of sugar, and carefully turn the
            ramekin to get a thin coat over the entire surface. Using a blowtorch, carefully melt the sugar,
            trying to get even caramelization over the whole surface (this takes a little practice.) You can
            return them to the fridge for 5 minutes or so before serving if you like to firm the custard up a bit.</li>
