        <h3> Ingredients </h3><br><br>

        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 package active dry yeast, 2¼ teaspoons</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon plus 1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>3¾ cups bread flour, 469 grams, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons sea salt</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the bowl</li>
            <li>¾ cup whole-milk Greek yogurt</li><br><br>

            <h3> Directions </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium bowl, combine the water, yeast, and 1 teaspoon of
                     sugar. Let the mixture sit until it's foamy on top, about 5 minutes.</li><br>

                <li>In a large mixing bowl or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, 
                    combine the flour, salt, and remaining tablespoon sugar. Add the yeast 
                    mixture, oil, and yogurt, and mix to combine. Knead the dough, either 
                    in the stand mixer on medium speed or by hand on a clean work surface, 
                    adding more flour if needed, until it's soft and slightly sticky, 7 to 
                    10 minutes. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover with a towel or 
                    plastic wrap, and let rise until it's doubled in size, about 2 hours.</li><br>

                    <li>Preheat the oven to 500°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li><br>

                    <li>Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and divide it into 12 equal 
                        balls. Cover and let rise an additional 20 minutes.</li><br>
